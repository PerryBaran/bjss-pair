# BJSS Pair Programming Task - LBTT

Pair Programming task for BJSS online interview. Tasked with creating a function that can calculate Scottish Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT).

Tax brackets information got from [Stamp Duty Calculator](https://www.stampdutycalculator.org.uk/stamp-duty-scotland.htm). Currently the calculator assumes:
- The buyer of the house currently owns a property and lives in it as their main residence.
- The buyer does not conduct any kind of business activity from their house i.e., it is purely for
personal use.
- The buyer does not own any other properties.
- At the end of the purchase the buyer will still only own one house i.e., they intend to sell
their current home at the same date they buy the new one.
